In this project, I applied machine learning regression techniques to predict molar volume and electronic conductivity of mixtures of metallic oxides with variable composition
Used online available dataset for molar volumes and conductivity founded experimentally.
Analysed how SiO2 conductivity does not depeneds on temperature and thuse silicon oxides deviating from arrhenius equation
